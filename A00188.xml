         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For, hereunto we are invited by the precepts and counſells of the graueſt and moſt wiſe, eſpecially of that Poet:</p>

            <p>But to conclude in a word, for I deſire to be briefe; I grant (indeed) that ſome Courtiers are too immoderately and ambitiouſly prone, to hunt after honour, preferment, rule and riches, and (which doe as it were naturally grow out of them) to pleaſure and voluptuouſneſſe; and that they do more highly eſtimate theſe externall vnconſtant and ſlippery things, than is conſonant, or convenient either to time, place or perſons: Yet notwithſtanding it is no conſequence that for ſome particular ill addicted and vicious Courtiers, the Court and Courtiers in generall who officiate good and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary

            <p>Wherefore, that we may be at libertie, and void of all feare; let vs haue this in continuall contemplation, and conſideration, that the ſorrowes, difficulties, and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes wherewith euery Chriſtian in this wretched life is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed, are manifold. Let vs therefore with heedfull hearts coniecture and caſt in our minds, by what eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all<note place="margin">A remedie to auoid danger in the Court.</note> meanes we may ſubiugate and ouercome them. Art thou then (kind Courtier) willing to receiue a remedie againſt them? then let this be thy ſweete and ſoueraigne Antidote, that with graue <hi>Cato,</hi> you be of an honeſt and vncorrupted life and conuerſation; that with inuincible Vertue, modeſt baſhfulneſſe, and innocent abſtinence,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:657:16"/> thou ſtriue to get the maiſtery, and to be good in deed, rather than ſeeme ſo to be, whereby it will come to paſſe, that by how much the leſſe thou ſhalt ſeeke after honour and preferment, by ſo much the more thou wilt vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly atcheiue the ſame. Now all this while, it is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to me, that it is a generall rumour and report, that there be not many good men to bee found in the Court, and that according to the opinion of many, few men doe bring good Arts and Sciences to a Campe or a Court; and therefore ſome no doubt may ſay, that I doe but waſh an <hi>Aethiopian-Blackmoore,</hi> in inuiting and inciting Courtiers to ſuch integritie of life: God forbid, yet indeed, I confeſſe, that it is extreame hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, for one perticular man alone, at a delicious, ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and bountifull banquet, at which there is extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary great prouiſion of meate and drinke, to bee ſober and ſatiate, and yet ſome one of a more ſage and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate condition then the reſt, may ſo moderately and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly gouerne himſelfe, that he doe not either in meate or drinke exceed the bounds of modeſtie and competent ſatietie: Euen ſo (kind Courtier) although in Court, thy vertue, integritie, and ſinceritie, may be diſquieted, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned, yea, and that it may ſeeme to liue in exile or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; yet if thy mind bee well formed and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med therein, it will aſſuredly cauſe, that amongſt manie fawning ſmooth-bootes, falſe hearted flatterers, and crooked perverſe minds, thou ſhalt ſtill be of a right and vpright courage and condition; yea, and from this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thou ſhalt deriue all thoſe ſiluer ſtreames, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable currents, whereby thy Calling, whether Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or otherwiſe, though formerly obnoxious to grieuous and dangerous defects, ſhall yeeld backe and repay vnto

If hereupon thou firmely faſten thine Anchor, then feare no Ship wracke, but with vnconquerable courage and animoſitie, Launch out into this turgent and turbulent Sea of the Court, and vndoubtedly thou ſhalt vanquiſh and ouercome the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinite ſwarme of amphibious and prodigious monſters of impietie, which may make incurſions, and encounters vpon thee. Therefore (generous Courtier) ſtart not backe at theſe euils, but ſtep forward againſt them, with a bold Spirit, proceed I ſay, and put this counſell in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, and let not the Philoſophie of effeminate and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted men diſtract or diſturbe thee from thy purpoſe, and determination, which of it ſelfe is moſt honeſt and laudable; reiect and caſt from thee vnprofitable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable ſpeeches, and hearken to God the fountaine of infallible and inuincible veritie it ſelfe. <hi>Maledicta Terra in opere tuo: In ſudore vultus tui veſcer is pane tuo.

For, if

This Inſtructrix and faithfull Miſtreſſe, will demonſtrate vnto thee, what a multitude of men do fondly admire and much wonder, what ſhould be the cauſe, why they are ſo greatly and grieuouſly day and night vexed and perplexed. Finally, He which is well fraught, and furniſht with the wholeſome precepts of Philoſophie, ſhall in concluſion bring himſelfe to the King of Kings, and Prince of all Princes, that is, he ſhall be reduced from the vnlimited and illegitimate worſhip of the Creature, to the Creator himſelfe; and ſure, I thinke, that he which is thus prudent and prouident, is not wiſe in the leaſt degree; for, euery Chriſtian Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ought eſpecially to take care, and make a Conſcience hereof, namely, that he be ſo exerciſed in the Court of his Prince here, that hereafter hee may without Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke of Conſcience, atcheiue and arriue, at the Hauen

            <p>Now then after the ſtudie of Wiſedome, let not the<note place="margin">Law, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</note> Courtier by any meanes omit, or neglect the Studie of Law, Languages, and Eloquence; and let him eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, bend his beſt endeuours, to attaine vnto the prompt, perfect, and moſt commendable Knowledge of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,<note place="margin">Hiſtorie.</note> and Antiquities, to which, indeed I cannot ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently moue and admoniſh him: For, this Knowledge is the <hi>Teſtis</hi> of the Times, the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Memorie,</hi> the <hi>Miſtreſſe</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie.</hi> Yea, this ſame Hiſtoricall Knowledge (if wee may beleeue <hi>Polybius</hi>) is a moſt ſound and ſure directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, inſtruction, and preparatiue, to all well managing of politique affayres, and is, indeed, a ſingular tutrixe, and faithfull informer, how to abide and ſuffer patiently the inconſtancies, and mutabilities, of brittle and fickle For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.

            <p>Thus the Courtier, being adorned and dignified, with theſe wholeſome precepts, and alſo fortified with Gods gracious ayde and aſſiſtance, and being lawfully elected and incorporated, into the Societie of Courtiers, let him thus proceed, and leaue the iſſue and euent to God, who doubtleſſe will direct and protect, all his affaires ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately, and effectually, that he ſhall with proſperous ſucceſſe, wade ouer, and wiſely wind himſelfe out of all difficulties, and diſturbances whatſoeuer.

Let him leane and truſt to a ſtrong wall.</hi> Yea, and let the Courtier, no leſſe wiſely and willingly, ſearch out, and deſire to ſerue, a moſt prudent, than a moſt potent Prince, or Potentate: for, this is a <hi>Maxime</hi> as true as Truth it ſelfe, that the Offices and dutie of Seruants is euermore adorned and illuſtrated, by the honour and dignitie of their Maiſter: let him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be perſwaded, that to liue vnder a moſt wiſe and mightie Monarch, is not thraldome and ſeruilitie, but freedome and libertie. Wherefore he which findeth ſuch a Court, to wit, a good, a great, and a gracious Prince: a Prince, for his ſound iudgement and much experience, moſt Prudent, and for his great dignitie and authoritie, Potent, and Puiſſant, I counſell and aduiſe that Courtier, by all meanes to follow ſuch a King, ſuch a Court. And And let not any fleeting or flying tales ſo moue thee, as to remoue, ſeparate, and alienate thee, from ſo good a Prince. If in the meane while, any ſiniſter, diſtaſtefull, or aduerſe accident, oppoſe or oppugne thee, beare it pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, harden thy ſelfe againſt it induſtriouſly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and doubtleſſe Time will (in due time) demul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceate, mollifie, and mitigate thoſe things, which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeemed moſt obdurate, difficult, and intricate. For, euen as a Souldier in his kinde of life, and a Mariner, or Seaman, well ſeaſoned with skill for all ſeaſons, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing dangers as iminent as euident, knowes which of them, will proue moſt perillous, hurtfull, and pernicious.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:657:21"/> Euen ſo ought euery Courtier, ſo ſoone as euer hee hath caſt and contriued, to lay the platforme, and foundation of a Courtly life, to ſee and foreſee, what in the Court is hopefull, what hurtfull, what is profitable, what vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; Yea, what is ſeaſonable and befitting, and what is vnſeaſonable and vnbefitting: For, they are fooles, and by no meanes to be endured, which will hope beyond and againſt hope, that is, being altogether anxious and vncertaine, doe depend vppon an obſcure, blind and hopeleſſe hope. Let him then which is wiſe, beware of this, leaſt thus he lead, and miſ-lead himſelfe and others. And indeed, how is it poſſible for him, who with ſuch vaine hope, brings himſelfe into a fooles Paradiſe, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and frame his counſels and affaires, to a direct and deſired end and concluſion?</p>
            <p>Let the Courtier therefore, with all conuenient expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, endeuour and deſire to know, whither he bee to ſettle his hope, vpon the riſing, or declining eſtate of his Prince. Moreouer, let the Courtier apply, and bend all his power, ſo long as he continues in the Court, that as much as in him lies, he be very morigerous, and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully officious to his Prince, but yet ſo, as that hee doe<note place="margin">Obſeruance or obedience.</note> nothing with pricke of his owne Conſcience. By obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience I here vnderſtand piety, or an honeſt, reuerent, and religious care, whereby wee heedfully heare, and duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully finiſh, and accompliſh, the Commandements of one lawfully commanding. For, what can ſuch a man doe or well performe, which is not of a quicke, and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hearing, but is ſo dull and vndiligent, in vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and apprehenſion, that hee doth not rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, nor is duly and truly capable of what is either commanded or demanded. Be thou therefore (good
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:657:21"/> Courtier) very well affected to this Vertue, if thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to inſinuate, and creepe into the fauour and affection of thy Prince. Thinke with thy ſelfe, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more vnindifferent, vnreaſonable, or more void of diſcretion, than for a man to deſire to be reuerenc't, and obeyed by his <hi>Inferiors,</hi> who himſelfe is moſt way-ward, and vndutifull to his owne <hi>Superiors:</hi> therefore hee is ſurely a happie and fortunate man, who vnto his facilitie and eaſineſſe in hearing, and apprehending, doth couple and conioyne promptitude and readineſſe in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, but alwayes with this <hi>Prouiſo,</hi> and exception, that he vndertake not to finiſh or effect, any diſ-honeſt, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, or vnlawfull Command whatſoeuer; but let him kindly and courteouſly entertaine, that excellent ſaying of <hi>Aeſchylus, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Obedience is the Mother of felicitie.</hi> Let the Courtier then which right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and honeſtly deſires, to decke and adorne the forme and faſhion of his life in the Court, and to make his Prince his friend and fauourer; as alſo to bee expert and cunning in counſelling himſelfe, &amp; contryuing all his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and affaires. Let him (I ſay) diligently ponder, and ſeriouſly conſider theſe things. But after that his labours haue beene with prompt expedition, ſuſtained and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, ſince the eſtate and condition of Courtiers is very ſlippery and vncertaine, as they, who indeed are too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and too eaſily circumuented, and enuironed, with the fraudulent accuſations, and malicious detractions of wicked men: Let the Courtier therefore, well and wiſely<note place="margin">To demand his Pardon.</note> ſhift for himſelfe, and prouide a remedie againſt them: let him (I ſay) in his firſt entry or ingredience into the Court, Couenant, or Compact with his Prince, that hee will vouchſafe vnto him a generall pardon; and let him
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:657:22"/> diligently take heed, that this Patent of his Purgation be not by the neceſſitie of the Time, ſubtilly, or violently taken from him.</p>
            <p>Now as touching Liberty, and Freedome in ſpeaking,<note place="margin">Of libertie of ſpeech.</note> which Princes (for the moſt part) doe take very diſtaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, I muſt herein alſo admoniſh the Courtier, becauſe indeed they are but few, which freely and faithfully doe aduiſe, admoniſh, and aduertiſe Princes; Thou therefore whoſoeuer thou be, which wilt ſhew thy ſelfe not to be a counterfeit, falſe hearted, or ſained, but rather a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruant to thy Prince, follow not ſo faſt, ſeeke not ſo much the glittering ſplendour of fickle Fortune, &amp; thine owne priuate commoditie, as the Truth, which by no<note place="margin">Truth.</note> meanes ſhould be concealed, but honeſtly reuealed, whenſoeuer it may redound, and be conducible to the commoditie, and honeſt vtilitie of thy KING, and his Common-wealth; therefore thou being wiſe, wiſely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to ſpeake, vntill fit time and occaſion, be happily offred vnto thee.

Life and Death are in the power of the Tongue.</hi> Wherefore, be thou neither a futile, or vnprofitable babler, by vnſeemely <hi>Loquacitie,</hi> Neither contrariwiſe, let thy <hi>Tacitarnitie</hi> or ſecrecie, be vnhoneſt, but iuſt and ingenuous: And eſteeme that Silence neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and ſufficient for thee, whereby without either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God, or the common good, thou doſt retaine, and keepe vnto thy ſelfe thoſe things thou knoweſt; leaſt they be diſperſed and ſpread abroad, to the preiudice of thy Prince, or any other perſon.</p>
            <p>But now that I may returne to ſpeake of the ſtudie of Veritie or Truth, whereof (kind Courtier) I heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,<note place="margin">What Truth is.</note> thou wouldſt be a heartie-louer: and wherein I wiſh
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:657:22"/> thee, not only a ſtudious Practitioner, but a perfect Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, which that thou maiſt the better vnderſtand, I thus define. Verity or Truth I take to be ſuch a Vertue, whereby we ſpeake of, praiſe and promote any thing, ſo, as the Perſon, or thing praiſed or ſpoken of, is, abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of it ſelfe. Hence then is commanded that we ſpeake no otherwiſe of any thing, than as the matter is plainely in it ſelfe. But thou wilt peraduenture obiect, thou fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt danger or deſpight thereby: feare it not, for tis far better, and much more commendable, to ſuffer death it ſelfe, than either to oppreſſe or ſuppreſſe Truth or good councell, And queſtionleſſe a good Prince, doth much more highly eſtimate, and valew a faithfull Councellor though dead, then a falſe-hearted flattererand diſembler, though aliue.</p>
            <p>For, no vaine counterfaite or prophane, thing can be of long continuance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherefore, let neither the time terrifie, nor neceſſity diſhearten, nor wicked and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, moue, curbe, or diſturbe, the good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courtier, from truth and honeſty; but with conſtant <hi>Socrates,</hi> let him be ſtill the ſame, immutable, immoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Excellently ſaith <hi>Caſſidore,</hi> concerning Iuſtice, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice (ſaith hee) knowes no father, nor mother, it knowes Truth, but makes no difference of perſons, it directly immitates God. Doe thou the ſame, (kinde courtier) and that thou maiſt come, very neere to the nature, condition, and diſpoſition, of God himſelfe; loue Truth: And if thou deſire, that others ſhould ſpeake the Truth to thee, do thou hate and abhominate, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth in thy ſelfe: But perhaps, thou wilt ſay with the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall Poet, Veritas odium parit, Truth hatcheth Hatred.</hi> And what hatred I pray thee <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>median</hi> doſt thou meane?
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:657:23"/> why man, Truth brought euen death it ſelfe to <hi>Pollodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> that noble <hi>Architector,</hi> to <hi>Papinian</hi> the Lawyer, to <hi>Socrates,</hi> that famous <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> yea and to many others beſides, what then? ſhall wee therefore, maintaine a lye againſt truth? God forbid. Indeede tis true, I confeſſe it, that truth, is oftentimes abuſed, miſuſed, troubled, &amp; tormented; yet for all this, as <hi>Salomon</hi> teſtifies <hi>Labium veritatis, firmum erit in perpetuum, The lips of truth, ſhall endure ſtedfaſt for euer.</hi> And <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his <hi>Oration</hi> for <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> ſaith <hi>Omagna veritatis vis &amp;c. O the admirable power of truth, which can moſt eaſily, ſuſtaine and maintaine it ſelfe, againſt all the ſagacity, and moſt acute ſubtilty, craft, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable treachery, of mans braine, or breſt whatſoeuer.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme it then a greater glory and grace, to ſuffer diſgrace for truth and verity; then to receiue much honour, and preſent preferrement, for falſhood and flattery. It may bee, the hatred, which thou pretendeſt that this truth wil ingender, is with the vulgar ſort, or common-people; well, be it ſo, yet aſſuredly, amongſt true and faithfull frends, nothing is more acceptable, nothing more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lactable, than truth and ſincerity, if it bee not imbittered, with churliſh, or vnciuill aſperity, and improper or ill proportioned, with rigid roughnes and ſeuerity, which euermore ſhould be abſent from amiable truth. But I am the more willingly inclined, more copiouſly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate, and intreate of this virtue, which, ſince it cannot by any meanes bee kept in corners, but will abroad into the light; may not ſlightly be glanc't at, or lightly be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ouer.</p>
            <p>Vnto all theſe ſound and ſolid arguments, ſome Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier may peraduenture, yet farther obiect and ſay, that it is dangerous, all waies to ſpeake the truth in a Court, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:657:23"/> in difficult, doubtfull and intricate matters: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede I cannot gainſay it, and I know aſſuredly, that in ſuch caſes, a man had need of a more than vulgar or common with and iudgement, and that in ſuch aſtraight exigent, if a man will keepe and conſerue, good will and reputation, and auoide the infamous blot and ſpot, of diſloyalty, he hath now ſomething, to ſet his wits a worke on.</p>
            <p>Goe to then, put caſe it be thus, yet not witſtanding I will (as God ſhall enable mee) take away the obſtacle, and remoue the rubbe and ſcruple, which may in this caſe, ſeeme to trouble thee.

If the matter, about which the queſtion growes, be abſolutely true, and perſpicuouſly apparent, then I know thou art not mou'd with it: but if it be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vnknowne to thee, and more intricate, than that thy preſent intelligence, is able to winde into; then thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt a demurre, and art peraduenture at a <hi>non-plus:</hi> Thou maiſt then, with theſe and ſuch like formall ſpeeches, iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excuſe thy ſelfe to thy Prince. <hi>As touching this matter, or counſell, as a thing both profitable and honeſt, I thus deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer my minde, ſo farre as the matter is manifeſt vnto mee, As I coniecture, as it ſeemes to mee, So farre as I can geſſe, apprehend, and vnderſtand.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like formes and kindes of ſpeeches, being honeſtly vſed, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly deliuered; the Prince, may receiue very ſufficient content and ſatisfaction: and if his counſels and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations, obtaine not a happy and hoped iſſue and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:657:24"/> the Courtiers iuſt excuſe and purgation, need not be to ſeeke, which alſo a gracious Prince, will doubtleſſe accept and take in good part.</p>
            <p>Now it followes that wee ſpeake ſomewhat concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the deliuering of our ſuffrages, iudgement and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in publike, ſerious, and important deliberations &amp; conſultations; Obſerue this, that in many other matters,<note place="margin">Raſh ſpeech Condemned.</note> delayes are dangerous and vnprofitable, but here, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtination or diſcreete deliberation, is very behoofeful, beneficiall, and comfortable.

Haue this alſo in frequent conſideration &amp; often remembrance, that the entrance and beginning of all things, is at the firſt on-ſet, hard and difficult; And euen after the ſame manner, the the formoſt voice, in all councells and deliberations of importancy, is moſt hard and hazardous. Therfore hee doth wiſely, which makes one more wiſe than himſelfe, his <hi>Preſident</hi> and <hi>Precedent,</hi> and diſcreetly adheres and cleaues to him; and yet ſo, as that he doe eſpecicially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend and rely, vpon his owne opinion, iudgement, and arbitriment, not altogether vpon an others, for, as almoſt in all other things: ſo likewiſe heere.</p>

In theſe, and ſuch like affayres, let the Courtly Counſellour be alwayes moſt ready preſt to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt ſuch workes, as may be propice and profitable to his Prince and Countrey: Herein I ſay let him be verie diſcreet and prudent in counſelling, as alſo moſt cunning

Therefore to vſe delay or protraction of time, and either by reaſon of the dullneſſe of wit, or ſlow motions and conceptions of the minde, or elſe through want of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Iudgement, to procraſtinate and put off from day to day buſineſſes, and imployments of great importance, and eſpeciall moment, will not onely be very preiudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and obnoxious to thy credit and eſtimation, but euen to thy Prince himſelfe moſt vnpleaſant and vnaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>Againe, let the Counſellour or honourable Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,<note place="margin">Not to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Secrets.</note> mind and marke this, that he be not too forward to divulge and make knowne the waightie and important affayres, committed to his truſt and fidelitie; but what in him lies, let him couer and conceale them vntill ſuch time, as they be effectually diſpatched and concluded. But if otherwiſe, ſome with enuie will ſpeedily ſo proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and perſecute thee, as very much to hurt and hinder thy noble actions, or elſe others will not ſticke to accuſe thee of remiſſeneſſe, and want of wiſedome, that ſuch and ſuch buſineſſes were not with more celeritie, and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion performed.

            <p>Furthermore, I would here ſuggeſt and put into the<note place="margin">To be alwaies in action.</note> minde of the wiſe Counſellour, this needfull and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry admonition: namely, that like the Sun he be alwayes as it were in continuall action; that is, That as much as in him lies, he liue not without employment; this is the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:657:28"/> meanes to acquire and get a noble name, renowne, and reputation, eſpecially if he doe ſpeedily and fortunately officiate the affaires of his Prince.</p>
            <p>Now in the true and due deliberation and execution of ſuch actions, let the Courtier be hereof moſt aduiſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carefull, that he wrap vp in ſilence, whatſoeuer may either be hurtfull, or not helpeful therein. For, in this caſe, as the ſaying is, <hi>Grau is iactura loquelae eſt, Great damage</hi>

            <p>Now after all this, theſe ſubſequent conſiderations will<note place="margin">To doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without the Princes knowledge.</note> alſo deſerue thy frequent meditation, to wit, that thou attempt not any thing, though thou aſſuredly know it neuer ſo profitable, without the priuitie and conſent of thy Prince, eſpecially if he be not farre remote and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from thee: for, what may he thence collect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, but that thou didſt contemne his Princely prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue; neglect him not therefore by any meanes, neither determine any thing, though in the ſmalleſt matters, or moſt eaſie and commodious manner, thy Prince not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therewith firſt acquainted.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, if the Courtier haue commiſſion to execute<note place="margin">Rules for an Embaſſadour.</note> the place and employments of an Embaſſadour, let him not either by his owne authoritie, or by occaſion of more

Yet notwithſtanding (kind Courtier) that, is not to be vnderſtood of publicke, but of priuate affayres.

            <p>Againe, whither thou be ſent as an Embaſſadour, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour, Interpretour, or Ledger, in time of Warre, or of Peace; either for the preſent, or for long continuance; for parle or performance of any affayres whatſoeuer,<note place="margin">Not to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take matters aboue his power.</note> thou muſt now moſt diligently enter into conſultation with thy ſelfe, and examine thy power and facultie, what

For, there is not a greater token of fooliſhneſſe, or foole hardineſſe, than for a man to take vpon him the execution of ſuch a Function or Office, as he is not able ſafely to vndergoe. Beware therefore I ſay, and that ſeaſonably, that thou do not at any time, affect or deſire thoſe things, which either thou knoweſt, or at leaſt ſhouldſt know, will be by thine impotencie, infirmity, and debility moſt obnoxious, moſt pernicious vnto thy ſelfe, or others, be heedfull herein I<note place="margin">What is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour.</note> aduiſe thee, and with a iudicious heart, poyſe and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in mind, the poſſibilitie, and efficacie, as well of thy bodie, as of thy wit and diſeretion; What thou art able to compaſſe by thy wiſedome, learning, and eloquence: as alſo how expert and circumſpect thou art to contriue any thing.

For, no wiſe man ſurely will gaine-ſay, but that euen in the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty or gracefulneſſe of the body is a certaine genuine and imbred honour, and reuerence repreſented.

Now to theſe external ornaments, let him adde the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and nobleneſſe of other things, which as in all others ſo eſpeciallie (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teſtifies) are in a noble Courtier, moſt conueniently to bee prouided; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he looſeth the reputation and renowne of his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and excellency.</p>

Theſe things as they doe very much deface and diſgrace euen
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:657:36"/> the beſt ſpeechees a man can deliuer: ſo, are they moſt patent and apparent arguments, of a light and vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant mind, which none ſurely but euen a meere ſot, or one that hath not ſo much as one eye of vnderſtanding, but moſt certainly knowes to be true.</p>
            <p>Againe I heere aduiſe euery Courtier, that if at any<note place="margin">A Caution.</note> time, he deſire to ſhun, and avoide the danger and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of his Princes indignation, that he ſuffer not his offices, Place or dignities to be taken from him, by any others, than by his Prince himſelfe: for doubtleſſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be very ſilly and abſurd, for any man to expect a remuneration and recompence from any others, than from him to whome he deſires, and endeauours his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours may worthily bee approued; therefore I wiſh &amp; aduiſe thee, (kind Courtier) that thou bee not alwaies<note place="margin">Not to be too frequent with or abſent to long from thy Prince.</note> preſent with thy Prince, nor too long abſent from him, doſt thou deſire to know my reaſon? tis this, the one procures hatred and weariſomeneſſe of thee, the other cauſeth vnmindfulneſſe &amp; forgetfulneſſe of thee, be not therefore I ſay ſo abſent from the preſence of thy Prince as that he vtterly forget thee, neither do thou ſo often &amp; importunately intrude thy ſelfe into his preſence, as that thy perſon proue irkeſome, and vngratefull vnto him, but that thou maieſt to thy ſpeciall benefit and with his fauoure and affection, be abſent from him thou maiſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to compaſſe and procure ſuch fauourable and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Embaſſages, as thou maiſt imagine obſerue and perceiue, will be gratefully acceptable to thy Prince; by this meanes, though abſent in body, thou ſhalt be ſtill preſent in the heart, and affection of thy Prince, and as a new and lately entertained fauorite, mayeſt with ioy and alacritie comfortably returne vnto him.</p>

            <p>Thou, Courtier, then whoſoeuer thou art, that art ſicke of this enuious diſeaſe, breake the fury, vanquiſh the fellneſſe thereof I aduiſe thee. For, as a veſſell which is muſtie and vncleane, at the firſt, doth quickly and moſt eaſily putrifie, ſpoyle, and defile whatſoeuer good liquor or moyſture is put therein: So a minde vitiated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminated with this ſhrewd, lewd, and diſhoneſt diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and inclination to enuie, can neuer purely poſſeſſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:657:37"/> perfect quiet, and tranquillitie. Wherefore either let the Courtier neatly, and pleaſantly, frump and flout the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and deſpightfull ſpeeches of the enuious, or elſe as wiſely and wittily retort them, as they are maliciouſly darted againſt him, but neuer let him with violence, or vehemence, repugne or repell them, eſpecially if they proceed from a <hi>Prince, Primate,</hi> or principall man of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. For tis Wiſedome with patience to endure and ſuffer, not to reuenge and reproue that which cannot be otherwiſe altered. Let Courtiers alſo vnderſtand and know this, that enuie is (as it were) the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon peſtilence and infection of a Court, which as it is connatiue with man, ſo doth it with man (either amongſt them of equall or inferiour condition) ariſe and grow vp. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (kind Courtier) doſt thou deſire a preſeruatiue againſt it, and to haue a ſalue to heale this dangerous ſore; I deſire thee at leaſt to abate &amp; extenuate it by court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, graciouſneſſe, and affabilitie. If in the meane ſeaſon any chance or miſchance befall thee, by the enuie of the impious and vngodly, thinke thus with thy ſelfe, that all men cannot (at all times) continue excellent &amp; eminent: for, in ſhort time many may be erected to the top of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, and the ſame men be as ſuddainly deiected to the depth of diſtreſſe and calamitie, and thoſe eſpecially which liue in Princes Palaces. For, can any man poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble be ſo ignorant of this our humane caſe and condition<note place="margin">The conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</note> as not to know, and to bee vndoubtedly aſſured, that Courriers according to the will and pleaſure of their Prince, are ſometimes happie, ſometimes vnhappie, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mightie, ſometimes miſerable? What if this ſhould come to paſſe, which alſo is a humane caſualtie, and in a Prince, as he is a man excuſable, and to bee endured,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:657:38"/> namely, that without any great reſpect of iudicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, he magnifie and lift vp this or that man, to the higheſt ſtep of honour and dignitie, or contrariwiſe that he vilifie and thruſt downe to the very bottome of baſeneſſe, a man famous for his noble linage, vertue, and literature; and whoſe merits haue beene moſt meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the Common Wealth. Thou maiſt hence (I ſay) learne (friendly Courtier) by this and ſuch like, to endure that which thou wilt hardly approue: yet feare and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to cenſure thy Prince, if thou meane not to deceiue thy ſelfe; for ſo farre forth as he is pleaſed to vſe his owne Princely power and authoritie, let his will be thy rule of Iuſtice. Neither let the old or new examples which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Germany, France, and Polonia, put any other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations and conſiderations into thy heart. But let this<note place="margin">The Princes will the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers tule.</note> juſt and vpright Law ſatisfie and content thee; <hi>Principis tui voluntas tibi ſit firma, rata &amp; grata. Let the pleaſure of thy Prince ſettle, firme, and confirme thine.</hi> Wander not farther then this I aduiſe thee, if thou be wiſe. It may be ſome ſubtil violent and immoderate motion of the mind may diſſwade, and perſwade thee otherwiſe; but I ſay ſtill, let reaſon and experience rule thee, and iudge not that to be raſhneſſe or diſhoneſtie, which ſeemes to thy Prince right and equitie; For ſurely that Courtier which by this meanes ſuffers ſhipwracke, in the ſea of the court, ſhall, <hi>Improbe &amp; iniqne</hi> (as the Prouerbe is) <hi>Neptunum accuſare, Accuſe Neptune vniuſtly.</hi> For, as the Mariner which once or twice hath ſuffered Ship-wracke on the Sea, if when he approcheth neere dangers, he ſtriue not to auoid them, wants not opportunitie and fit occaſion, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing entred into the Sea againe, to fall into, and daſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vpon the ſame miſfortune. After the ſelfe ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:657:38"/> that Courtier which hath ſuffered diuers and ſundry ſiniſter miſchances, and diſaſterous ſlips, in this ſlippery way, and vnconſtant fauour of Princes, hath no cauſe to promiſe to himſelfe any certaintie, nor can he in ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and turbulent ouerflowing floods, aſſure vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a calme ſea, or a ſure and ſecure ſeate, I meane a peaceable and contented minde.</p>
            <p>Furthermore (kind Courtier) if thou haſt reſolutely reſolued, and determined to vndertake any large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, courſe, and continuance vnder thy Prince, enforce thy ſelfe to the vttermoſt of thy power, to expreſſe thy<note place="margin">Promptitude.</note> promptitude and induſtrious diligence in thine office or calling. For, as raſh malapertneſſe and diſobedience, doe hurt, hinder, yea, and vtterly breake off Courtly procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; ſo aſſuredly obedience, prompt, and readie preſt obſeruance and diligence, doe commend, promote, and aduance the excellent endeuours of an honeſt Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier.</p>
            <p>Let the Courtier alſo which deſires and aſpires to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and preferment by his Prince, haue this care &amp; due<note place="margin">To be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his Princes preſence.</note> conſideration, that as much as ere he may, he be euer oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied &amp; exerciſed in his Princes ſight, that he may take notice of his diligence, yet let this be done very ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and not too importunely: Let him therefore in this reſpect obſerue the moſt ſeaſonable times; for vſually ſuddaine and vnexpected employments are iminent and ingruent to Princes, which they (for the moſt part) will credit, and commit to their diſpatch and performance which come next into their preſence.</p>
            <p>Let the wiſe Courtier alſo obſerue and note this, that<note place="margin">To preferre things preſent before future things.</note> alwayes he preferre things preſent, and not perillous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore future and feareful things, if ſo be that which is good
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:657:39"/> and honeſt doe not prohibit the ſame; for, he which puts not a period and iuſt limitation to his rouing &amp; rauening luſts and deſires, or preferres future things, which many times proue bitter, and diſtaſtefull, before things preſent, greedily gaping after new offices, and imployments; doth ſeldome or neuer gaine much thereby, but like <hi>Aeſops</hi> dog, while they couetouſly ſnatch at a double doubtfull commoditie, they moſt commonly looſe their ſingle cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie. Wherefore I againe and againe exhort the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, that he herein be aduiſed, and that he looſe not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, for vncertaine things: for to vſe a meaſure in our deſires, is a ſpeciall point of wiſedome, and modeſtie, and not <hi>Spem praetio emere,</hi> to buy our hope at too heauie or deere a ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Let vs alſo know thus much, that although yong Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers be for the moſt part very rude &amp; fooliſhly inſolent, yea, in many things much to be reprehended; yet they not being groſſely defiled with any haynous offences, or capitall crimes, are therefore in ſome ſort pardonable, and to be excuſed: For tis good that euery one ſhould haue this in due conſideration;</p>

Let vs bee guided with this rule, through the whole courſe of our life, that we may (what in vs lyes) haue <hi>Peace</hi> with all men; and wage Warre onely with their vices. Now in the meane while, euen thoſe Courtiers which, as much as they are able, doe couer and conceale the outward appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, and demonſtrations of their inward conditions, and inclinations, doe, notwithſtanding ſoone or late breake forth, and diſcouer what is in them: ſo that they which with ſo great care and circumſpection, would haue cloaked and kept cloſe, what manner of men they were, haue (at length) in one vice or other, bin openly detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Let Courtiers therefore in this regard, looke to themſelues, and although they may fondly ſay, and ſo ſaying deceiue themſelues, That no man ſees or can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt them, yet let them know and know aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the <hi>All-ſeeing eye</hi> of Gods knowledge doth (as it were) through the Looking-glaſſe of Heauen, preſently behold and diſcerne whatſoeuer the heart of man, moſt priuily and priuately conceiueth.

            <p>Furthermore thou (kind Courtier) which art a man,<note place="margin">Not to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by women</note> and borne to bee of a manly ſpirit and diſpoſition, ſuffer not thy ſelfe to be ouer rulde by women, eſpecially ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ignorant women; for, nothing almoſt can be to any man more wretched and ſlauiſh, then to abaſe and indignifie himſelfe ſo far, as to obay the rigid rigorous &amp; many times vniuſt command, of imperious and impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous women: whereby indeede he doth no better than apparently ſeeme to neglect, reiect, and refuſe, that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable prerogatiue wherewith God his all bleſſed Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, had from the beginning honoured him.</p>
            <p>Now come we to lay downe ſome few directions and inſtructions, how the Courtier may carry himſelfe in the change and alteration of a King or kingdome. As in all other things, ſo likewiſe in this, a meane is the beſt.<note place="margin">How to carry himſelfe in the change of a Prince.</note> Wherefore a new Prince being inaugurated and inueſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into his Crowne &amp; kingdome, ſhew not thy ſelfe too
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:657:41"/> ſad and ſorrowfull, nor too glad pleaſant and ioyfull; what then? heare; and make vſe.

            <p>When the Courtier perceiues that his Prince in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne, bountifull, and liberall diſpoſition, is forward and ready to conferre and beſtow vpon him, any honeſt and Princely profer or preſent pay of ready mony; let him vſe no delayes but with all celerity and expedition, let him (yet with an honeſt minde and carriage) receiue and accept of it; for, aſſuredly tis farre better to haue in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſſeſſion, than to hope with long expectation, and once <hi>tene, tene,</hi> is better than an hundred times <hi>Cape, Cape.</hi>

Why euen thoſe will counterfeit and diſſemble, that they reioyce at thy proſperitie and well-fare, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeed they enuie the ſame, and doe inwardly grieue, when they ſeeme outwardly to ſmile. Neither are theſe the trickes of Courtiers onely, but euen of the whole world, which indeed makes thoſe that deſire and looke for that better life in heauen, to deſpiſe and hate this here on earth. And who indeed that hath any ſparke of grace, or is poſſeſſed with any contempt of the vanitie and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of this preſent life, is not aſhamed to thinke, that he can gather Figs from Thiſtles, Grapes from Thornes, or pure Wheat out of droſſe and Darnell.</p>
            <p>But I proceede, and here admoniſh the Courtier, that he beware of thoſe dignities and preferments, which by reaſon of too eager deſire, to bring his friends alſo into office and promotion, are a great hindrance to the better performance of his owne proper, and peculiar affayres. Beneficence is indeed a noble vertue, whereby we accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">Of Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</note> to our power, doe aſſiſt, and do good to thoſe which are worthy the ſame.

            <p>In Court alſo he whoſe words and deeds doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,<note place="margin">To be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</note> is not to be truſted, no though he ſweare and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt nere ſo deepely; but a wiſe and religious man will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be as good as his word.

To haue one thing hatcht in the heart, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing coyn'd vpon the tongue, not to eſtimate and value Amitie and Emnitie, according to their true propertie, but according to commoditie; and rather to carry about with vs, a faire face than a faithfull heart.</hi> O but doe thou (kinde Courtier) feare and forbeare theſe things, and deſire ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be than to ſeeme to be.</p>
            <p>Be carefull alſo herein, namely, that thou be faithfull<note place="margin">To be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> to others, if thou wilt find others faithfull to thee, for that man in my iudgement, vniuſtly, yea, fond and falſly complaines he is deceiued, who himſelfe did firſt deceiue others. As for example, There are vnhoneſt minded Courtiers, who peraduenture, deſire to diſplace their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; and that, no doubt many times, vnder a colour of higher and greater preferment, will ſeeme to prayſe him for his learning, iudgement, and vertue, that thereby,

Now what if thou in like manner (that thou maiſt vntie one knot by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) ſhouldſt as ſubtilly circumuent and enſnare ſuch a like aduerſarie, with as craftie and ſlie ſtratagems as his owne, and ſo ſhouldſt retaliate and repay his deceit with deceit, craft with craft?

Euen ſo when I here obiect vnto thee ſmall and innocent wiles &amp; ſubtilties, I intend them not, for the enſnaring or abuſing of other men, but as an opportune couerture, and protection of thine owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and Fortune. And finally, I onely vrg'd it to this end, that if occaſion were offered, thou mightſt repay craft with craft, and recompence the malignant ſubtiltie of thine enemie, with Serpentine fallacy.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, as touching matters of great moment,<note place="margin">What is to be done in doubt full matters of moment.</note> which we cannot aptly and exquiſitely vnfold, or lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to our Prince, we muſt demonſtrate and declare to him thoſe things, wherein cuſtome and much vſe hath made him moſt familiar, &amp; beſt acquainted; make choice therfore with all care and curious election of ſuch a one, who is faithfull to thee, whom thou knoweſt well, and doſt aſſure thy ſelfe is free from flattery. For, aſſuredly as the ordination &amp; inſtitution of a Courtiers life is moſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:657:45"/> auncient, ſo is flattery an inueterate and venimous euill, both to the Court and Common-wealth, yea, this euill (if we will beleeue <hi>Curtius</hi>) is perpetuall, it doth oftner more priuate harme, to the well-fare of a Prince, than a war-like open enemie can doe. Truly tis a thing very much to be lamented, that ſo many worthy men, ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably borne, ſo aboundant in all wealth and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie that a Court or King can afford, ſhould notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, vtterly baniſh from them amiable Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and moſt freely giue entertainment to falſhood and flattery. For, certainely to ſpeake the truth with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of flattery.</note> the chiefeſt and moſt ſage of all the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> in his fourth Booke of his <hi>Ethicks, Nuſquam plures qui familiari ſermone, et conuict u blando, gratiam Principum aucupantur; quam in aulis.</hi> Neuer were there moe knowne, which with familiar ſpeech, and ſmooth behauiour, did ſo hunt after the grace and fauour of Princes, as in Kings Courts.

Hence I collect, and not without iuſt cauſe conclude, that flatterers like impious impoſtures are moſt worthy of hatred, for whiles this moſt peſtiferous kind of creatures doe thus carrie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,<note place="margin">Flattery hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſincere friendſhip.</note> all ſincere offices of faithfull friendſhip are vtterly forſaken, whoſe ſpeciall property amongſt many others, is to admoniſh, and be admoniſhed, to doe the one free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without bitterneſſe, and to indure the other paciently, without reſiſtance, which friendly offices whiles they be thus entertained, they are ſincerely and faithfully done, and friends hereby doe not eaſily runne headlong in ſin

But heere I muſt intreate the reader that he would not entertaine ſuch a thought of me, as that, what is now to this purpoſe ſaid or written is out of any enuie; peraduenture I haue writ ſomwhat too freely, (which if ſo) yet truly tis free from all malignant bitterneſſe. And indeede if wee will conſider one thing with another, who is hee that knowes not that there be

            <p>And when the Courtier hath by his Princes bountie<note place="margin">Gratitude or thankfulneſſe.</note> and liberalitie, obtained any benefit or commoditie, let him (ſetting apart all proud oſtentation, and vaine glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſelfeflation) make knowne, and tell abroad by whoſe bountie and benignitie he receiued the ſame, and he muſt by all meanes endeuour to retribute all condigne thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to him alone for the ſame. For it were very vniuſt &amp; vnindifferent for any man to ſeeme to haue atchieued, and deriued that, though nere ſo little, from another, which hath onely flowed from the fountaine of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fauour.</p>
            <p>Now furthermore, as touching money, he that knowes<note place="margin">Of money &amp; couetouſneſſe thereof.</note> not how to vſe a meaſure in the hauing &amp; crauing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, let ſuch a Courtier be expelled the Court, as hauing vncleane hands, and a corrupted heart. For, can there be any preſent good hap, or future good hope in a greedie couetous man? He as <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſayth, neuer endeuours to tread the paths of truth and equitie, becauſe as he is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnfurniſht of all good Sciences, and honeſtie: ſo is he totally filled and fraught with craft and meere kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery. Auarice is expert in the trade and ſtudie of fingring money, which no wiſe man will immodeſtly deſire or ſeeke after, and with great reaſon, for, this, as being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:657:48"/> and wholly infected with deadly poyſons, doth make both the ſoule and bodie of man moſt degenerous, foule, and effeminate, tis alwayes infinite and inſatiable, tis neuer abated by plentie, or pouertie. Worthy <hi>Saluſt,</hi> thou ſayſt moſt truly and wiſely indeed. For, doubtleſſe as gold is try'd by the <hi>Touch ſtone,</hi> ſo is man try'd by gold. What then, canſt thou expect from a Courtier dedicated and vtterly addicted to an inſatiable and greedie gaping after gold, and filthie gaine? In whomſoeuer this is found be ſure to find theſe alſo, to wit, hard-heartedneſſe, a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled mind, violence, craft, and knauery, trecherie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, rapine, diſloyaltie; And what if we hereunto adde, with that excellent Oratour. <hi>Tam ſanctum eſſe nihil vel ſolenne, quod non auaritia violare ſolet et comminuere. That there is nothing ſo ſacred, ſoueraigne, or ſolemne, which aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice doth not violate and extenuate.</hi> I deny not, but that it is honeſtie and diſcreet prouidence, for any man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide, and furniſh himſelfe with all vſefull neceſſaries for him and his; but haue we not ſeene and knowne, that theſe haue beene by many Courtiers got and gained with a foule, ſpotted, and ſtained conſcience: by ſuch I ſay, who neuer had learned wiſely to limit the vnlimmitted bounds of inſatiable couetice. Wherefore be moſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly perſwaded hereof (kind Courtier) that if thou multiplie thy Riches, and amplifie thy Fortunes by the ruines and wrongs of other men, thou wilt not ſpare nor feare to be iniurious to thy Countrey, Prince, and neereſt or deereſt friends.</p>
            <p>And though Kings and Princes (the eſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things ſo requiring) are moſt liberall and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to this or that man, paying vnto them, and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vpon them moſt large ſtipends, and rich reuenues;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:657:48"/> yet be not thou (good Courtier) ſo auaritiouſly minded as to deſire and indeuour to wreſt, and violently (as it were) to extort from thy Prince his wealth and treaſure, whither he giue or denie what thou deſireſt: heare and make vſe of this counſell and wholeſome admonition, which that I may more perſpicuouſly and euidently illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, take by the way this ſhort example: I ſuppoſe that no man is ignorant, that euen at Feaſts, and moſt ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Banquets, there is alwayes ſome one or other which is not ſo reſpectiuely entertained as the reſt: ſo is it in Courts, wherin ſome haue what they hope for; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome leape ſhort of that they long and looke for. Let Courtiers conſider this, not the new vpſtarts, or thoſe which were lately initiated into the Court, but which haue ſpent and beſtowed the greateſt part of their Age in this kind of life, and then I doubt not but they will inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly and freely confeſſe, that what we haue herein ſaid, is moſt infallibly faithfull and true.</p>
            <p>Let the Courtier alſo indefatigably ſtriue and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,<note place="margin">To be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious and diligent.</note> that he may not ſeeme to his Prince idle, lazie, or too remiſſe and negligent in the ſpeedie diſpatch of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and employments: for ſuch a ſeruant certainly will he not vouchſafe (and that deſeruedly) ſo much as to looke vpon, holding him no better than a troubleſome burthen, or an vnprofitable drone, and as not worthie to liue amongſt induſtrious, laborious Bees, wherefore let the Courtier be carefull to expreſſe himſelfe profitable, diligeent, and euer readie preſt to performe what he is commaunded, let him I ſay ſhew himſelfe a labourious Bee, not an idle drone, ſleepie dormouſe, or pernicious waſpe, in his Princes Palace.</p>
            <p>Now I make no queſtion, but that Courtiers are (and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:657:49"/> indeed with ſpeciall good reaſon, as chiefly appertaining<note place="margin">How Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wiſe &amp; politique.</note> to them) very inquiſitiue, and deſirous to know by what meanes they may beſt acquire and attaine vnto Courtly wiſedome and policie; I therefore thus anſwere both the Courtier and Politician, namely, that the knowledge of them both, is thus eſpecially obtained, by much reading, frequent employments, long experience, proceſſe of time trauaile into fortaine Countries wiſely diſpoſed, diligent obſeruation of the liues and conditions of men; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, by wiſe contemplation of Kingdomes, Courts, and Common-wealths. Now whoſoeuer is graciouſly and egregiouſly furniſhed with theſe; ſhall not onely, in hope, be profitable to himſelfe; but alſo in deed moſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Prince: And whatſoeuer Courtier ſhall haue purchaſed this prudence to himſelfe, ſhall aſſuredly find himſelfe intentiuely and readily prepared for all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons offered. And indeed, to ſay the truth, without fit opportunitie, euen vertue, or whatſoeuer excellencie may conſiſt in any Courtier, yea, in any man what ere he be, doth pine, lanquiſh, and lie dead in him.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, let the Courtier indeuour by all poſſible meanes, that by ſome honeſt office or other, he ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, louingly reſpectiue of all Princes, ſo that they be not his enemies, whom he is moſt neerely and neceſſarily obliged vnto, otherwiſe he will be contemptible and hatefull vnto them. And if he cannot performe offices of obſeruance to all, yet at the leaſt let him not contemne or diſdaine them, and let him wiſely auoid, and free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the ſuſpicion thereof, for in ſuch and ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold changes and chances of humaine affayres, he which to day was great and mighty, may ſuddenly ſinke down, and a meere ſtranger ſucceed him. Let Courtiers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>Truly I cannot ſufficiently incite and ſtimulate Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,<note place="margin">Obſequious pliantneſſe.</note> to the exquiſite and readie performance of due and true pliantneſſe, and humble ſeruice; for this is, as I may ſo call it, the bait and birdlime, whereby he vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purchaſeth and procureth to himſelfe, the fauour and affection of all men, and once gained firmely, keepes and conſerues the ſame.

            <p>Now he which is poſſeſt with ſo honeſt an inclination, may hence learne to brooke and beare with many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtations and griping grieuances, vntill hee happily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue at the hauen of his hope, and haue hit the marke he aimed at, namely, vntill he patiently and peaceably, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend the right and direct ſteps, vnto honour and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red dignities.</p>

            <p>Moreouer let the Courtier heedfully endeauoure to follow the enſample of an ingenuous generous ſouldier,<note place="margin">To propound vnto himſelfe a paterne for imitation.</note> who intending to imitate ſome noble and victorious Captaine in the warres, frames and confirmes, his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and practiſes, his fortitude and magnanimity, as

            <p>Now as touching taking of reuenge, although the<note place="margin">Of taking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge.</note> Court eſpecially, doth oft times miniſter fit occaſion therevnto, when the ſtate and affaires of thy foes may be for diuerſe reaſons, in anxious and ſiniſter caſe and condition: Yet not withſtanding, an honeſt and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly generous gentleman, ſhould then eſpecially curbe and correct himſelfe.

That there is nothing more commendable, than for a man to be truly content with the memory of his good deeds, and perfect libertie, and to contemne and ſet at naught the things of this life; if that good fortune which was expected haue fallen out, we ſhall be glad; but if otherwiſe, yet I reioyce, although what I haue bin, and what I might haue bin, I cannot be.</hi> If thou therefore ſhew thy ſelfe ſuch a man, and be for the ſame deſpiſed and hated, yet notwithſtanding kicke at and contemne euen this contempt; if ſo be that thou haue ſet downe this certaine reſolution, to perſiſt and perſeuer in doing thoſe things which are honeſt, iuſt, and true.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, let the Courtier be carefull, leaſt whiles he indeuoureth to ouer come by pliantneſſe and obſervance, he ſlip into Adulation and flattery, whoſe picture alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die we haue indifferently painted forth.

            <p>Againe, let the Courtier as farre as he is able, moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately tread in the direct footſteps of his Prince, and<note place="margin">To obſerue his Prince in all things is very great wiſedome.</note> obſerue moſt diligently, what he allowes, what he diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.

I haue alreadie incited and inuited thee to humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and modeſtie, therefore I omit to inſiſt farther there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, one onely word by the way, let me adde thereunto, namely, that if humilitie be linkt and knit together with authoritie, it makes it exceeding acceptable, yea, and to be had in wonderfull admiration; <hi>Melius eſt vt tibi dica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, aſcende huc, quàm vt humilier is coram Principe; It is farre better, and much more credit</hi> (as that moſt prudent King <hi>Solamon</hi> admoniſheth) <hi>that it be ſayd to thee, come vp hither, than to be deiected and ſet lower in the preſence of thy Prince.</hi> Finally, take and make vſe of that of the wiſe <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> whereof he very excellently aduiſeth thee. <hi>Inſecundis nemo confidat, in aduerſis nemo deficiat, alternae ſunt vices rerum.

            </p>
            <p>Let this then I ſay, make the Courtier circumſpectly<note place="margin">To prouide for his owne well-fare in due time.</note> wiſe, that if at any time it ſo fall out, that he perceiue his Princes fauours to be turned into frownes, and that the enuie of his enemie begins to take growth againſt him, let him then with all conuenient maturitie deſire an honeſt diſmiſſion, to depart from the Court, and of himſelfe to lay aſide his Courtly dignities, rather than to expect when he ſhall be by others enuiouſly eiected. The rule is this. <hi>Praeſtat praeuenire quam praeueniri. It is farre better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, than to be preuented.</hi> Which whenſoeuer occaſion is offered, to prouide for thine honour and reputation, I wiſh thee to make good vſe of. But ſince there is nothing in the Court of Princes more perillous, or pernicious to Noble Peeres, and great Stateſmen, than are backbiters and ſlaunderers. And the aſſiſtants and ſuggeſters vnto
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:657:61"/> ſlaunder, are ignorance, iealouſie, hatred, traps, and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie. Therefore tis not amiſſe euen for the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in this reſpect, to be very aduiſedly carefull and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect, that ſuch worthy men and wiſe Counſellours; men I ſay of moſt worthie merit &amp; deſert, of their Prince and common Wealth, may not by ſuch baſe and ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious men, of whom we haue formerly made mention, be ſo iniuriouſly defamed, abuied, and euen Butchered.

            <p>Now an ambitious Courtier is he, who vnder pretence<note place="margin">An ambitious Courtier.</note> of amplifying and enlarging the royalties and dignities of his Prince, in all his actions followes the line of his owne luſt, diſplaceth his auncient; honeſt, and approued <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligues,</hi> or fellow officers, ſubſtituting, and ſuborning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there, whom he pleaſeth in their places.</p>
            <p>If any thing be by the Prince mentioned, or proffered<note place="margin">Of marriage.</note> to the Courtier, as touching Matrimony, he ſhall doe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnwiſely, if he refuſe to be directed therein by him. But let him rather ſo farre incline himſelfe, that he make no contract or agreement, without the good liking, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and pleaſure of his Prince; What good, and how great profit may hence ariſe vnto him, no wiſe man but may well perceiue, and vnderſtand.</p>
            <p>Let the Couriter alſo contemne and ſcorne thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,<note place="margin">Not to vſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct courſes to riſe to honour.</note> which he cannot attaine vnto, without the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating of groſſe impietie; for, as <hi>Violentum nihil diutur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, Nothing violent is permanent:</hi> So queſtionleſſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer

Obſerue good Courtier, what is prepoſterouſly repugnant to reaſon, what is wicked, what vniuſt, and hate the ſame. And whither in time of Peace or War, thou enterpriſe any thing, accomodate thy wit, thy will, thy power, and policie to the full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and diligent diſpatch thereof.</p>
            <p>And ſince the affayres of great men are very vnſtable, anxious, &amp; variable, truſt therefore rather to thine owne power and vertue, than to any others. Let not that moue or moleſt thee, which no wiſe man wonders at, that in the Court ſometimes illiterate Idiots proue great men. Truly it oftentimes comes to paſſe, that ſuch as theſe do for a ſeaſon, enioy the fauor &amp; friendſhip of their Prince, and doe fondly perſwade themſelues, that they may free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without controulment or correction ſay, or doe any thing, what ere they pleaſe, but alas, they quickly come downe, and ſo doe all thoſe that are not ruled by vertue and reaſon, but by their owne vile and vitious affections, adminiſtring to themſelues occaſion of their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and running headlong into the pit they had prepared for others. Conſider theſe things (kind <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier</hi>) I aduiſe thee, and when thou ſeeſt ſuch a one plac't and grac't aboue thee, though thou doe not approue it, yet doe not reſiſt, but beare it contentedly. And in the <hi>interim,</hi> be vigilant and prouident, that baſe fellowes make thee not as bad as themſelues.</p>
            <p>Be alwaies in all things very cautelous and circumſpect<note place="margin">A caution for rich Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.</note> when thou art to deale with thy Prince, but eſpecially if thou be wealthy and rich, leaſt afterward thou be forc't to ſay, &amp; to ſay too truly, my village goods &amp; good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, wherein I once inebriated my ſelfe haue now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done

But theſe I ſay are moſt worthy to be deteſted and hated of Princes, and euen to be thruſt out by th'head and ſhoulders, and vtterly baniſht the Court.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, let the Courtier ſo modeſtly, wiſely, &amp; aduiſedly, behaue himſelfe that as neere as may be, he be able to approue and iuſtifie his actions and imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to his Prince; nor let him vndertake any thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the Court wherein he liues, his Prince not being acquainted there with; ſo ſhall he repell and beate backe the deadly darts of enuie, which otherwiſe vpon light and ſlight occaſions, may be either from his Prince or others leueld and ſhot at him.</p>
            <p>Let the Courtier alſo take heed, that he wrong not ſuch<note place="margin">To take heed whom wee prouoke to anger and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.</note> a man whoſe brethren or kindred, may iuſtly be feared will be furious and fatall reuengers thereof.

Magnifie not thy ſelfe, againſt thoſe which can ſuppreſſe and pull thee downe, and ſtriue not to ſtand vpright, there where thou art conſtrained to fall downe flat. This one thing remaines, that thou hurt no man, but if thou thy ſelfe be hurt or moleſted with petty iniuries, tis farre better contentedly to endure them, than with any the leaſt danger to indeauoure to repell them.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:657:62"/>
            <p>Againe, let the honeſt and religious Courtier who is of equallity in power and authority, indeauour by all meanes to eſtabliſh vnity and concord, and let him vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly reiect and caſt a way all iarres, grudges and ſeedes of diſſention, which are indeede more pernicious than the tooth of a fierce dogg, or the ſting of a poyſonous Serpent.

            <p>Furthermore becauſe the neceſſity of a mans Country,<note place="margin">To traine vp and bring vp Horſes.</note> the greatneſſe of renowme, and abundance of riches doe all require that a courtier ſhould be very forwardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to bring vp horſes, and by how much the more noblely, and generouſly minded a man is: ſo much the more willingly doth he ſpare no coſt, vpon a beaſt of a ſtout ſtomacke, tractable to be trained vp to warre, and fit for the defence of his perſon. Therefore I ſay the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier ſhould not be pinching &amp; ſparing, but moſt forward &amp; ready, in the buying &amp; bringing vp of ſuch a Beaſt, eſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecially if he perceiue his Prince to be delighted with the view &amp; exerciſe of the moſt generous ſtouteſt and ſtateli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Horſes. What needes many words? he muſt not only traine vp horſes, but himſelfe oftentimes backe them &amp; exerciſe his body to riding. For aſſuredly that of <hi>Criſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> in <hi>Xenophons</hi> fourth <hi>Pedia</hi> is very remarkeable and worthy obſeruation, who ſo highly commended the cunning and skilfullneſſe of riding of horſes, that he thought aſſuredly he could fly like a bird, had be bin a<note place="margin">of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Horſes.</note> good horſe man; and certainely this Horſe-riding is a warrelike exerciſe and moſt befiting a Prince or Noble <hi>Peere.</hi>

I doubt not, but there are many of a cleane contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who certainly in mine opinion are not in this caſe to be credited, for if we doe compare one thing with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what excellent knowledge and experience ſhall he poſſeſſe, both of affayres, cuſtomes, and tongues, beyond him which neuer ſaw any others, than ſuch as himſelfe, nor ere lookt farther than his Fathers cottage, or into his owne Pariſh Church; Trauaile therefore cannot queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe but be very profitable and neceſſary for a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, yea, for any generous or ingenuouſly educated gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman whatſoeuer, eſpecially if it be ordered and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, not onely for priuate pleaſure and delight, but for a publike profit and vtilitie.</p>

               </gap>ſſe; for, vnder correction be it ſpoken, All Courtiers are eyther by nature ſo formed, or by education ſo addicted, that they hold it a ſpeciall poynt of wiſedome, or policie at leaſt to couer and coullour their hatred with falſe, fained, and faire concealments, and thereby doe oftentimes put forth and proffer their hand, to thoſe whom in their heart they hate, and giue them the moſt ſmooth and glauering termes they can deuiſe, with out any true or ſincere inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I may eaſily confirme what I here affirme, by a moſt probable and obſeruable example. That triple headed <hi>Cerberus,</hi> of inhumaine Tyranny, <hi>Caligula, Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> hauing deſtroyed many famous and moſt vertuous men; whoſe crueltie and Butcherie a certaine auncient,<note place="margin">Marke this.</note> and graue Courtier hauing wiſely and very ſubtilly auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and eſcaped, and it being demanded by what meanes he amongſt ſo many eſcaped ſuch and ſo many ineuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dangers, and traps of their tyranny, his anſwere was, by often enduring iniuries, and by ſhewing himſelfe moſt thankefull, though he had ſmall cauſe for the ſame. Let the Courtier by all means follow his footſteps, &amp; though he liue not in the Court of any tyrannicall King, yet though he reſide and abide in the Court of a moſt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and iuſt Prince, let him either ſo fit and prepare himſelfe, as that he may be alwayes readie to ſwallow downe, and diſgeſt many, yea, any moleſtations and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, or elſe let him without delay depart from the Court, as moſt vnſit to liue therein. The reaſon queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe why many Courtiers doe make no progreſſe in their
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:657:67"/> proceedings, hath no other originall than becauſe their hopes are dubiouſly &amp; diuerſly diſtracted, and vnſettled in that they cleaue not firmely to ſome <hi>Patron</hi> or Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of them, and their fortunes. But be thou (kind<note place="margin">Note this.</note> Courtier) prudent and abſtinent, as alſo moſt confident that vertue is moſt valiant and inuincible being vnited to a ſtrong adherent. And doubtleſſe tis farre better, to combine and conioyne himſelfe, with ſome Primate or chiefe <hi>Peere</hi> as his Patrone and to follow him, then to be a follower of many and yet firmely affected of none, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely as he is no where which is euery where, ſo queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe, he that ſerues &amp; ſeeks after many, ſhall not ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or ſincerely finde any; for that which is diuerſe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perate cannot chuſe but be feeble and very deſperate.</p>
            <p>Let the Courtier neuer be obuious or oppoſite to the pleaſurs of his Prince, ſo they be honeſt and warrantable, for otherwiſe he may quickly fall from the fauour and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection<note place="margin">Not to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to his Prince.</note> of his Prince, &amp; in vaine does a man ſtriue againſt the ſtreame. And certainely a man muſt ſometimes yeild &amp; ſubmit to time, place, and the perſon, of friends: yea, he that liues with his Superiors had not need to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and ſtriue but to winke &amp; conniue at many matters and rather ſometimes to looſe his owne right, than with loſt labour, or rather eminent danger to conteſt or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with his Prince or ſuperior. And yet as I haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſaid, this is to be conſidered with this <hi>Prouiſo</hi> that it be ſo farre forth, as he may with a ſafe conſcience, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelfee and the renowne of his Prince.</p>
            <p>Furthermore ſome other impious and ignominious Courtiers, haue a tricke to try their fortunes, and to<note place="margin">Slanderous accuſations.</note> hunt after the fauour and affection of their Prince by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt inquiſitiue to ſearch, and finde out, thoſe with
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:657:67"/> whom they vnderſtand the Prince is offended, that they may moſt malitiouſly and pernitiouſly, accuſe them to their Prince with vniuſt accuſations, infamous lyes, and ſlanderous imputations; examples heereof are extant both auncient and moderne in <hi>Germany, France, Spaine,</hi> and els where, but that which was moſt conſpicuous and ſenſible to <hi>Seneca</hi> is moſt memorable.</p>
            <p>If in the Court, the Prince haue 2. 3. or more in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for ſuch and ſuch matters of ill demeanor, let ſuch then as will ſhew themſelues wiſe, intermit and leaue off frequent conference &amp; much priuate talke or whiſpering amongſt themſelues; which if they doe not they may chance to ad fuell to the fier, or put flax into the flame; &amp; farre better it is to ceaſe &amp; aſſwage, then to foſter and increaſe the ielouſie and ſuſpition of the Prince; for, ſince as hath formerly bin toucht, the ſuſpitious man is moſt commonly deceiued; why may not a Prince alſo erre and be deceiued, in his ſuſpicious imagination; which his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror I could wiſh that thou (kind Courtier) wouldeſt be the cauſe to diſcouer, vnleſſe by thy wiſdome and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right dealings, thou canſt openly and boldly annſhilate the impulſiue or primary cauſe thereof.</p>
            <p>Let the Courtier addict himſelfe vnto, and decke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe<note place="margin">To bee of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous behaui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>our.</note> with vrbanity and moſt ciuill demenour, and be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with merry pleaſant and witty conceits in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference or talke, but let him by all meanes auoid both in ieſt and in earneſt, all quippicall taunts and ſatiricall bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting tearmes. For, hee which indeauours and deſires to purchaſe and procure the beneuolent reſpect of others by rudeneſſe ruſticity and barbaritie of ſpeech, doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcouer his owne ſimplicity, than any ſmooth or facile humanity, but that which is neatly and trimly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:657:68"/> being indeede the fruite of a witty inuention doth moſt delight and recreate the hearers, and is more ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſooner approued of by thy iudgement of the moſt indifferent, wherefore let thy merry ieſts and witty ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be gracefull and honeſt, not bitter or biting ſcoffs<note place="margin">Of ieſting &amp; merry ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> not deliuering the bare truth of things, which indeede were an occaſion to bite to the quicke, the party touched therein. Let the Courtier alſo put farre from him all Clowniſhneſſe which in ieſting and merriment ſhewes but a dull wit and ſlowneſſe, yea is very vnſauory and meerely fooliſhneſſe. Let him no leſſe ſet packing all <hi>Scurrility</hi> or ſaucy and malapert deriſion, which mirth is very ſhamefull and vnſeemely. Finally let him hate as a capitall enemie, vnciuill ſnapiſhneſſe, which alſo in merriment is no better then dogged ſnarling, and virulent or enuious biting.</p>
            <p>The faults and offences of impriſoned, m incarcerated<note place="margin">Of Courtiers committed to Hould.</note> Courtiers are not to be extenuated by any others in the Court, but are to be buryed at leaſt, in the depth of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, &amp; not mentioned at all by them. Neither yet muſt they priuily whiſper, or avouch openly, that ſuch men are blameleſſe and innocent, whom for enuy hatred and diſpleaſure, they apparently perceiue to be impriſoned: For certainely if it be our humaine condition to erre, and to be apt to ſlip by naturall infirmitie, euen the Prince himſelfe being violently carried away with a certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate heedleſneſſe, and heat of ſpirit, may in ſome one caſe or other commit an errour, yet notwithſtanding he is not bound to giue an accompt thereof to any priuate or particular Courtier whatſoeuer. Let not the Courtier therefore raſhly, and inconſiderately miſcenſure, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow what his Prince may be pleaſed to like of &amp; allow.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:657:68"/> Let him not excuſe or account ſuch a man as guiltleſſe, whom his Prince doth accuſe and condemne as guiltie of ſome notorious or publike offence; Princes haue their ſecrets, which who ſo ere dares or deſires to peepe or pry into ſhall hardly be free from danger, and giue moſt palpable and apparant ſignes of his groſſe impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. In this caſe therefore let the Courtier be very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telous &amp; circumſpect, that he diue not too deepe into this dangerous gulfe, but that he keepe neerer the ſhore, and that he wiſely conceale much more than he ſhall dare to reueale, and that he depreſſe and keepe in what he ſhould not expreſſe; yea, let this be the period of all, that ſilence is a ſafe &amp; ſure reward to him which imbraceth the ſame.</p>
            <p>Though peraduenture the Courtier may perceiue, that<note place="margin">A wiſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> he is vilipended, and not much reſpected or regarded of his Prince, yet let him very aduiſedly take heed, that he expreſſe not the leaſt ſemblance or appearance of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or diſcontent againſt him, but let him euery where carry himſelfe with all ſignes of obſequious obſeruance. He may freely thinke whatſoeuer he pleaſeth, for (as our Engliſh Prouerbe ſayes) <hi>thought is free;</hi> but let him take heed that he ſpeake not openly, what he hath in his heart conceiued priuily.</p>
            <p>In matters alſo of pietie and Religion, the Courtier<note place="margin">Not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelfe about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> ſhall doe exceeding wiſely, if he ſuperficially meddle not with too nice inquiſition after vnprofitable and vnneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary things, as about the innouation or alteration of <hi>Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in the ſacred <hi>Scriptures,</hi> yea, and let him endeuour to preuent all ſuch like actions, that hee may ſhew hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proues not the leiutie and inconſtancie of ſuch vaine and fleeting fellowes, by anſwering and ſubſcribing to their conditions, and thereby ſhew himſelfe a companion and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:657:69"/> copartner in their vnbeſeeming curioſitie. I would not (good Courtier) that thou ſhouldſt be too ſtrictly bound with this indiſſoluble bond of Religion, from which thou maiſt eaſily vntie and vnloſe thy ſelfe, without the prop and protection of others thy teachers and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. And that this admonition is not friuolous or fruitleſſe, the vnhappie times of our Forefathers, yea, and this preſent and moſt turbulent time in the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> doth moſt truly teſtifie.</p>
            <p>If any diſcord and diſſentions happen in the Court, let the courtly <hi>Chaplaine</hi> be very ſedulous to appeaſe and<note place="margin">Of Chaplains in the Court.</note> qualifie the ſame; to reconcile them as brethren, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh them as men, to reprehend and reduce them as wanderers, and going aſtray, and with the ſauory and wholſome ſweetneſſe of courteſie and gentleneſſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue and bring to nought the arguments of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents,<note place="margin">They muſt be Peace-makers</note> not to increaſe wrath, but to make peace and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe wrath, not to foſter faction amongſt the contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but to lull it aſleepe, yea, into a dead ſleepe, that it may not be eaſily awakned againe. Finally, not to plant the yong ſprigs, or to ſow the ſeeds of litigious diſcord, &amp; grudging betweene them, but with the ſickle &amp; ſword of Gods word, to ſupplant and eradicate the ſame.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:657:69"/> and Prouinces, it is no ſmall aduantage for a Souldier to make vſe of a well ſpoken Prelate, or Preacher of the Court, for if he be one that is excellently <hi>Rhetoricall,</hi> and ſubtill of ſpeech and arguing, he ſhall aſſuredly doe much<note place="margin">A politicke note.</note> more good thereby than a Souldier by his weapons in warre. The actions of thoſe moſt factious <hi>Ieſuites</hi> in the ſiege at <hi>Paris,</hi> and obtaining and taking in of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> by <hi>George Podibradius</hi> ratifies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes the truth hereof, who for all his faire and ſmooth tales had neuer attaind or enioyd the end of his deſires, if he had not vſ'd the vaile and vizard of <hi>Religion,</hi> &amp; made <hi>Roikiranus</hi> the Prieſt his ſpokeſman in the buſineſſe. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent examples alſo may we finde in other Kingdomes, and Nations, which here I willingly let paſſe, but this counſell although indeed it may peraduenture take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, yet for all that if any ſhould demand of me whither ſuch a proiect were to be practiſed, or prayſe worthy, my anſwere ſhould be, that ſuch counſell is not alwayes to be adminiſtred to a Prince, by a pious, religious, and honeſt Courtier.</p>
            <p>This queſtion alſo hath beene vrged by ſome prudent<note place="margin">Art and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> Courtiers, namely, whither a Courtier furniſhed with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent naturall parts be to be preferred before him which is adorned with Arts and Sciences, without the former.

Theſe things ſurely we muſt needs ſay, and hold for truth.

            <p>The Courtier which hath ſpent the flouriſhing ſpring time, and Summer of his Age in the Court, and which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo<note place="margin">Of giuing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to follow the Court.</note> by the gracious aſpect and reſpect of his Prince, hath atcheiued much honour, wealth, and dignitie, muſt not for light and ſlight occaſions relinquiſh the Court, but if ſo be that the times proue dangerous, if his trauailes and paine, be ouer-great and grieuous; Finally, if ſickneſſe or ſuch like, doe iuſtly moue and admoniſh him to another kind of life, let him honeſtly &amp; diſcreetly deſire a diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Court, rather than to change the continued courſe of his life, with a too ſuddaine or ſcarce honeſt and ſeaſonable alteration.</p>
            <p>Let the wiſe Courtier induſtriouſly and diligently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider<note place="margin">Of entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to familiarity.</note> in mind, whom and what a one he is whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaines in to intimate ſocietie and familiaritie, yea, into his adminiſtration and ſeruice. Touching thy Friend (kind Courtier) this is my aduice, that thou be not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſtie<note place="margin">Of Friends.</note> in making choice of him, and whom thou haſt cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen doe not raſhly put from thee.

            <p>Now alſo concerning thy Seruant, thou muſt ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly<note place="margin">Of ſeruants or attendants.</note> take heed, and ſeriouſly thinke vpon that prouerbe as true as auncient, <hi>Quot ſeruos habem us totidem habemus hoſtes, Looke how many ſeruants we haue, ſo many enemies we haue.</hi> Let no man therefore too farre truſt his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, nor be ſo conceited, that he can heartily loue thee,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:657:70"/> which ſerues thee more for feare then affection; And what man is he which is ignorant and knowes not, that there are and haue bin many men, who inſtead of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full freend and ſeruant, haue found a faithleſſe and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary hired witneſſe againſt them, yea a traitor vnto them? wherefore the wiſe Courtier had need to beſtow no little care and paines taking heerein. But let him eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially<note place="margin">To take heed offeruants in matters of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy.</note> take heed, that if at a feaſt or banquet or elſe where hee intend to ſpeake ſomewhat more freely then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of any matter whatſoeuer, let him as neere as poſſibly may be, exclude his ſeruants from the hearing thereof; For, how many diſcommodities &amp; inconueniences thoſe Courtiers haue incurred, which haue heerein been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe and careleſſe, is I am ſure, ſo ſure and certainely knowne, as that there needes not any proofes thereof by ſuperfluous or needleſſe relations.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Courtiers by how much the more potent and powerfull they are in regard of their Princes fauour, and affection toward them, are for the moſt part ſo much the more hated and contemned of others, vnleſſe they haue fortified that fauour and affection, with ſingular kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and affabilitie in themſelues. Certainely if any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie may be found againſt this mallady, or if their be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny liquidity or moyſture, which can extinguiſh or at leaſt diminiſh this furious flame of enuie; it is the ſweet iuyce of gentleneſſe &amp; courteſie.

               <note place="margin">Marke this good Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</note> was wont to ſay: <hi>Canibus frendentibus proijciendum eſſe frustum panis.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:657:71"/> meanes be pacified, with bitter neſſe and rough dealing (kind Courtier) I deſire thee therefore to obſerue and to follow the tract, and trace of that moſtnoble King.</p>
            <p>Princes newly eſtabliſhed, haue for the moſt part liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grous ſeruants, and contentious officers: and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they vſe to contend and ſeperate themſelues into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe factions for chiefe place and priority in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions: In this regard, I aduiſe and counſell the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier that he take heed of thoſe, who for their owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage and profit like <hi>Aeſops</hi> baſe and turne coat Batts, doe leane ſometime to this faction ſometimes to that. But concerning neutrallity we haue already deliuered our opinion.</p>
            <p>Although the Prince may in his owne peculiar loue<note place="margin">How to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fauour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</note> and affection, haue made choice of the Courtier, yet let him, all this notwithſtanding, indeuour to procure vnto himſelfe an honeſt and faithfull propitious <hi>Patron,</hi> who may ſtill kindle and increaſe the fier of his Princes affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to his farther felicity, fauour, and welfare: now in the interim let the Courtier little or nothing regard how hee be eſtimated, or accounted of by others, eſpecially the vulgar ſort, ſo that his Prince, by whom he may be promoued, and aduanced to dignitie and honour, doe approue and duely praiſe his fidellitie, painfullneſſe and induſtrie. excellent and very conſiderable is that which is recorded of <hi>Steuen</hi> King of <hi>Polonia,</hi> of whom it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that he ſhould ſay, to <hi>Caſtelanus</hi> at that time his high Chancellor, ſtanding by him according to the faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and cuſtome of his anceſtors, <hi>Faciam vt breui poſſis ſedere, I will make thee ſhortly ſit downe by mee.</hi> Eſteeme as nothing therefore (kinde Courtier) others that would ſeeme to pull thee downe, ſo long as thy Prince intends
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:657:71"/> to promote and preferre thee; feare not I ſay, if (maugre all the malice of any others) thy Prince be pleaſed to ſet thee downe by him, who lately didſt but ſtand, attending on him.</p>
            <p>Concerning veſtures and apparell, I aduiſe thee (kinde<note place="margin">Of apparell.</note> Courtier) let it not be thy leaſt care, for it may eaſily be that either by exceſſe or defect therein, may be ingendred and occaſioned either thy prayſe or diſprayſe, obſerue this alſo, that thou follow ſuch a habit, apparell, conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and actions, as may bring credit and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thee, and breed enuie in thine emulators.</p>
            <p>This alſo is the true nature and propertie of <hi>Court-lyers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A forget of lies in the Court.</note> that when they once begin; firſt a flying and vnfaithfull rumour is ſpread abroad, which by flying farther, like a ſnow-ball rowld in the ſnow, growes bigger and bigger, then ſome others, not of the meaneſt but higheſt ranke and order, affirme and auouch it, which thereupon is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged, promulgated, and made common in the mouths of all men, and by this meanes, doe blabbing and lying <hi>Courtiers</hi> begulle &amp; delude the credulous common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This vndoubtedly is euident enough, and more than ſufficiently apparent to all, which we might by moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and faithfull examples more liuely illuſtrate, but that examples of this kind are alwayes moſt odious.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I will now goe forward and here I alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe<note place="margin">What one a Courtier ſhould be.</note> the Courtier, that it is not ſufficient, that he be voyd of all vices, and free from foule enormities, and groſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities, vnleſſe he be adorned &amp; beautified with thoſe vertues, whereby dignitie, grace, and authoritie, may be purchaſed. Let him not therefore be careleſſe of his ſame &amp; good name, not couetous of other mens goods, but honeſtly ſparing and thriftie of what is his owne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:657:72"/> a prouident keeper and maintainer of the common good.</p>
            <p>The Courtier being aduanced and extolled to ſome<note place="margin">Of his carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent affayres, his Prince being abſent.</note> great and egregious height of honour, and dignitie, and in the abſence of his Prince being (as it were) preſident or principall Agent, in an intricate employment, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of great conſequence, being alſo deſirous to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the expectation of the common people; ſince he is not in himſelfe able to bridle, curbe, and keepe them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when they vniuſtly importune the death, captiuitie, or impriſonment of any one; let him wiſely diſſemble his anger and diſpleaſure, and let him affirme and proteſt, that he will do more good for them than they deſire, and thereby ſhall he in the <hi>interim</hi> ſet the innocent party at libertie, from vndeſerued danger and calamitie. This kind of Art or ſubtiltie, whenſoeuer opportunitie admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters occaſion thereunto, is very highly to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a Court.</p>
            <p>Now the pious, prudent, and intelligent Courtier ſhall<note place="margin">Of diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> doe exceeding well, to ſollidite and moue his Prince, that he would not frequently permit publike diſputations, or altercations in matters of Religion, the caſe is plaine;</p>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:657:72"/> this truth? How many Oceans of euill and <hi>Troian</hi>-miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, haue flowed from this fountaine? Alas, forſooth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery illiterate water-man, and paltry Porter muſt now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies proue a diſputant, muſt be ſhewing forth the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, and out-ſides of his wit and wilineſſe, and muſt firſt teach, before he himſelfe haue ere learned, or bin taught, and all theſe notwithſtanding (ſhame and ſorrow tis to ſpeake it) they themſelues doe vtterly neglect to liue pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, ſoberly, and vprightly. Gaine they not a goodly commendation? Get they not I pray a huge harueſt, and a copious crop of pietie, and religion thereby. O light leaues voyd of fruit! O ſmoakie ſhaddew without any true ſubſtance! Wherefore let the Courtier be ſuch a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of pietie and true Religion, that he may be a ſpeciall means to his Prince, that refractory and obſtinate irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men, may by his authoritie be forc't and conſtrain'd to liue in order and true obedience.</p>
            <p>Let the honeſt Courtier be euer of this honeſt minde, and neuer let him deſire or endeuour to fiſh with the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the waters of wilful obſtinacy, contention, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention. And indeed what other effects doth difference in Religion bring forth, but that euen ſubiects alſo be at variance and vtter defiance one with another. Let the Courtier I ſay, vnderſtand and know this, let him freely and faithfully put his Prince in mind of this, namely, that this <hi>Anchor</hi> cannot ſo eaſily be moued, but that the whole ſhip of the Common-wealth muſt needs be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and aſſuredly I am perſwaded, that hatred for the moſt part doth inhabite the hearts of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (through diſſention and difference in Religion) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe whom they hold and eſteeme either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe or aduerſe therein; nor be they afraid to doe harme
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:657:73"/> and iniurie to thoſe whom they imagine &amp; ſuppoſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to hurt euen God himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now whenſoeuer the Courtier conferres with his Prince, concerning theſe and ſuch like matters of great moment, let him endeuour to vſe a reuerent, reſpectiue, and moderate kind of ſpeech, and not vncomely or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely alter his countenance: For, doubtleſſe ſuch a kind of geſture and demeanor cannot but be very accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, delightfull, and forcible in a prudent Prince, yea, and thereby thou ſhalt (as it were) euen ſet before him a mirrour or looking glaſſe, wherein to contemplate, and behold thy modeſt mind, and ſweete conuerſation.</p>
            <p>It is almoſt vnutterable, how much it concernes euery<note place="margin">Affability and courteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour in a Courtier moſt excellent.</note> Courtier to be, both by naturall diſpoſition, and artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all acquiſition, faſhion'd and made ſit in the alluring and delighting men with his externall carriage and behauiour. Whoſoeuer therefore is by the goodneſſe of Nature or Art beſt garniſhed and furniſhed herewith, and can with ſpeedie expedition bring his affayres to a perfect end and finall concluſion; Such a Courtier whenſoeuer occaſion is offred wherein he may without all <hi>Thraſonicall</hi> brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, manifeſt and declare the efficacie and power of his wit and learning, ought euer moſt circumſpectly, and conſiderately to make vſe of the ſame. As for example, If he be to vndertake a buſineſſe of great import and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence with his Prince, let him very attentiuely liſten thereunto, not being defatigated or tyred with any other affayres, leaſt that which ſhould be ſeaſonable and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, become hereby vnſeaſonable and immature, that which thou wouldeſt haue acceptable, proue vnaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and leaſt thou find that which ſhould be profitable and commodious, vnprofitable &amp; obnoxious vnto thee.</p>
            <pb n="131" facs="tcp:657:73"/>
            <p>Let him therefore (if he be wiſe) as was form erly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, diligently obſerue a fit time and opportunitie, leaſt he, both ſuffer his talke to be vnperfected, and his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and hope proue vaine and be fondly fruſtrated: for, this is euer as ſure as ſure may be in the Court, Campe, and whole condition of a mans life, that <hi>Hope</hi> &amp; <hi>Rewards</hi> are euer moſt anxious, and vncertaine, which as much as may be, it is very fit and conuenient to correct and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie by a kind of Art, and perſpicuitie of wit and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.

But what I now admoniſh and aduiſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:657:78"/> thee of, I wiſh may be laid vp and kept ſafely in the moſt ſecret cloſet of thy heart and memory, namely, that there are a moſt peſtiferous kind of Courtiers, who for filthie <hi>Lucre's</hi> ſake, will auouch and confirme falſhold for truth, who will prayſe any thing which they haue by relation or report, either from the Prince, or Common people, whither it be honeſt or diſhoneſt, yea, and which on the other ſide will with the Prince or people vilipend and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe any thing whatſoeuer, be it nere ſo commendable, changing like <hi>Polypus</hi> not their ſuperficies or outward collour, but euen altering their mind and vnderſtanding with the change and mutation of their places of aboade. Certainly ſuch Courtiers as theſe, do neuer take any care to keepe a pure or vnſpotted conſcience to God, nor a good report toward their neighbours. But let vs conſider both Kings, Princes, &amp; courtiers, yea al men both publike and priuate whatſoeuer, that there is aboue and about vs, an <hi>eare</hi> to heare, an <hi>eye</hi> to ſee, and a Booke wherein all our words and deedes are writ and recorded: and that therefore in whatſoeuer kind and condition of life we liue we eſpecially chooſe and make choyce of pietie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teglitie, as our chiefe guides therein, and let vs be moſt cautelous and carefull that when we labour by all means to gaine the grace and fauour of our earthly Soueraigne, we thereby looſe not the loue of our celeſtiall Sauiour. O let vs marke and remember this, that the conſcience being maculate, and contaminated with ſin and impietie begets a worme, which will gnaw there eternally: but contrariwiſe, that the conſcience which is beautifull, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and free from groſſe enormities, doth wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſerue, nouriſh, and cheriſh in vs the ſpeciall grace and fauour of the Almightie.</p>

            <p>Whiles I aduiſe and admoniſh theſe things, me thinks thoſe vnconſcionable, vntutred, and vnlearned Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and ſuch as are ignorant of this humaine condition, may and that moſt iuſtly liſten to me, who to the end they may intercept and ſtop vp the way from better and more learned men than themſelues, by cunning craft and ſubtill ſtratagems doe imagine miſchiefe and deſtruction, yea, and as much as in them lies, doe preſſe and oppreſſe men, moſt worthie eternall laud and memorie. For, there is nothing doubtleſſe more vſuall and cuſtomary in the Court, than with malice, lies, &amp; calumniations, to curbe, keepe vnder, and enſnare, moſt excellent and eminent men, yea, ſuch as haue marueilouſly well deſerued of the Common wealth; by whom (alas) too often, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more lamentable, euen the good, diſcreet, and wiſe Prince himſelfe is by them ſold for gold and gaine.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, vnleſſe I be much deceiued, I haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a Courtier and a Souldier.</note> &amp; obſerued this difference betweene a Souldier and a Courtier, namely, that the Souldier for the moſt part vſeth plainely and apparently, to expreſſe and exerciſe his hatred &amp; diſpleaſure, and to ſpeake that with his tongue which he intends in his heart: but contrariwiſe, the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier (I meane the ſlie, ſubtill, and deceiueable Courtier) will cogge, counterfeit, couzen, and diſſemble his hatred if time and occaſion doe giue him leaue: wherefore ſuch as theſe in time of peace, and in a calme and quiet eſtate and condition of things, may eaſily ſupplant &amp; ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the plaine and vnarmed Souldier.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, let the Courtier remember this one thing, to wit, that he, very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            </lg>
            <p>But as they (I ſay) haue nothing to doe with Chriſt,<note place="margin">Helpefulneſſe to others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a wiſe Courtier.</note> ſo we haue nothing to ſay to them. Here alſo I aduiſedly exhort the wiſe Courtier, that if God haue giuen vnto him more wiſedome, dignitie, authoritie, vertue, and ſuch like excellent endowments, than to many others, that he then conſider with himſelfe, that he is ſo much the more obliged and bound to be helpefull and aſſiſtant to his neighbour, yea, and that both God and nature, yea, all wiſe men doe conſent herein, that it is very behoofefull and befitting all men, to be profitably helpfull one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Let not any Courtier therefore in this reſpect, exalt and magnifie himſelfe, or ſet vp the plumes of his pride aboue others, but let him in the feare of the Lord, make a modeſt and right vſe of Gods gifts, namely, that by how much he excels others, and is more excellent and eminent than they in the exquiſite ornaments of wit, or
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:657:86"/> ſome other ſingular vertue, ſo much the more lowly let him prize and eſteeme himſelfe, being alwayes mindfull hereof, that <hi>to whom much is giuen, of him will the great Maſter and Prince of heauen, exact and require much againe.</hi> Let the Courtier therefore be very modeſt, gentle, and beneficiall to others, or apt to pleaſure and doe good to all men; for, herein ſhall he indeed moſt neerely imitate God himſelfe.</p>
            <p>But ſince the Courtier (according to the opinion of the common people) liues a ſoft, ſumptuous, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate life, and is continually conuerſant and exerciſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſome noble ſubiect or other; namely, in doing ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to his Prince; Who is he, that can truely terme that man a good Courtier, in whom the vertues and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as well of the body as of the mind, doe not duely concurre, namely, a deſire to be in action and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, furniſht with noble thoughts, excellent qualities and conditions, heroicke exployts, and of a ſpeech well ſeaſoned and tempered with wit and facetious pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Aſſuredly let him which perchance is either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant hereof, or vnfurniſht herewith know and vnderſtand thus much from me, that tis not enough for a man to ſwell and puffe himſelfe vp with pride<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of ſome vaine and bare name of a Courtier, or with the Image and ſtocke of honourable progenitours, yea, or with the title and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed tittle of Nobilitie, or fleeting dignitie, and finally, that I may ſpeake with <hi>Griſpus</hi> the <hi>Hiſtorian; To ſeeme,</hi> but <hi>not to be the ſame he makes ſhew of;</hi> But this rather I ſay is the thing which is eſpecially required, that he which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be honoured and adorned either by the Court, or any other eſtate or condition of life, let him firſt adorne and beautifie it in himſelfe. But neuer ſhall he acquire or

            <p>Furthermore, let not a Courtier ſtriue beyond meaſure<note place="margin">Of prayſe.</note> to extoll and magnifie his Prince, with glorious prayſes, and gloſing phraſes; for, as wiſe men will certainely be offended, if thou too bitterly and ſharpely taunt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them: ſo queſtionleſſe, will truly wiſe men take it in exceeding ill part to be too extreamly &amp; vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended. Prayſe all things therefore ſparingly, indifferently, &amp; in due ſeaſon, for as it is in other things, ſo here alſo to obſerue <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> a <hi>decorum,</hi> is alwayes very profitable, and prayſe worthy.</p>
            <p>Now euen as a Phyſician in healing a ſickneſſe, and in curing a maladie or diſeaſed member hath a ſpeciall care, that whiles he applies the plaiſter or medicine to one member, he hurt not the other: euen ſo let the Courtier or courtly counſellour ſo aduiſe his Prince, that he would ſo prouidently and prudently prouide, and take care for his Common wealth, as that in protecting the one part thereof, he deſtroy not the other, eſpecially by exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of moneys, and heauie taxations.

            <p>Now before I put a period and full concluſion to this my labour and little treatiſe, I muſt truly tell thee (kind Courtier) this one thing, namely that the Court makes not a man better, but men rather may make the Court it ſelfe better, whereby I would intimate thus much, that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:657:89"/> tis not enough to liue in Court, to goe to bed at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Marke this.</note> to riſe the next morning at ten a clocke, and then what with apparelling himſelfe, with frizling and curling his haire with his curling pin, with poudring and turning vp the fame, this way and that way, about his eares, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing thus in his bed chamber, euen till noone at leaſt, and then to ſpend the reſt of the day in feaſting ieſting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and many ſuch like toyes and triuiall exerciſes and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes; aſſuredly I ſay (and let euery Courtier beleeue me) that he which is onely occupied and buſied in cropping theſe roſes, ſhall vndoubtedly finde then but pricking thornes on theſe trees, ſhall finde nothing but fruitleſſe leaues; ſhall find theſe vines both wilde and barren, in theſe garners ſhall find nothing but chaffe; and finally, in theſe treaſuries, ſhall be poſſeſt of nothing but meere counterfeit mettle. The Courtier (I ſay) which adheres, cleaues, and is inclined to theſe things aboue mentioned, cannot rightly vndertake, excogitate, doe, or begin to doe any thing, much leſſe perfectly finiſh or effect the ſame; he alſo which cleares not himſelfe of theſe things, ſhall finde many defects in himſelfe, and ſuch, as that, if hee mend not his manners, will giue him iuſt cauſe to weepe and lament.</p>
            <p>Let not that Courtier therefore thinke himſelfe a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie and fortunate man, which in the Court hath power to liue as he liſts. For if Courtiers were (which I would to the Lord they were) the moſt abſolute happy and perfect of all men, then aſſuredly, they which would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently profeſſe, and embrace a Courtiers life, might wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (as the ſaying is) all the world ouer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince we all know that there is no time of a mans life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that can be better ſpent than that which is ſpent, and beſtowed in the ſweete fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:657:89"/> of wiſe and learned men, yea, of ſuch as are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for their wiſedome, and excellent parts, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. Therefore that I may once for all (more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly) vnfold and lay open my full ſcope, meaning, and intention herein, this I ſay is the thing which I eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ayme at, to admoniſh thee (kind Courtier) name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that ſince euen Courts alſo haue their brambles, bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and thiſtles, no man ſhould therefore put too much confidence and hope in himſelfe, notwithſtanding all the glittering and glorious ſhew and reſplendent luſtre of a Courtly life, and ſo (by that means) alienate and eſtrange himſelfe from his God; but that he ſhould alwaies beare in remembrance, how many at all times in Kings Courts haue beene preſſed, yea, with lyes, detractions, and enuy oppreſſed, and that much ſorrow is ſheltred and hid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>glorious miſery;</hi> and indeed who can terme it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than a <hi>glorious miſery,</hi> when a man ſhall ſo liue, &amp; in ſuch a place, where (for the moſt part) he is ſtill ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect either to the danger of other mens malice and hatred<note place="margin">Theſe are not onely the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Courtiers, but of this age in generall.</note> or elſe himſelfe to haue others in hatred and deteſtation; where a man in outward ſhew of reuerence, with cap and knee makes bare his head to him; whoſe head (in his heart) he deſires, were ſmitten off; Others againe to be ſeene to bow themſelues low, and euen make a legge to him, in the working of whoſe deſtruction, they could be better content to breake their leg.</p>
            <p>Againe, is it not a thing much to be lamented, to ſee men daily to frequent each others company, to laugh and reioyce together; and yet all this while to foſter within their breſts moſt cruell and capitall enmitie and hatred each againſt other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is it not intollerable, yea, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible diſſimulation, that a man ſhould i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
